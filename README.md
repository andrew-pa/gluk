gluk
====

OpenGL 'utility kit' for C++
Those useful classes like shader, textures, render texturs, GLFW app class that you just end up using a lot.

Dependencies
====
GLEW + GLFW for OpenGL windows & extentions
GLM for math
GLI for texture loading
Uses CMake build system, which is still a bit funky.

Should be crossplatform with a few tweaks
